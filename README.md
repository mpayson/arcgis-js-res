## Display lots of features

#### `pipebins` [code](/pipebins.html) | live

> display 150k+ line features by displaying bins that fade as you zoom in to the underlying feature layer. once the feature layer is visible, you can select an area of interest to highlight features / query capacity statistics on the client

#### `pipetiles` [code](/pipetiles.html) | live

> same as `pipebins`, but with a hosted tile layer instead of a bin feature layer
